# advance-searching

This project provides an optimized implementation of Linear Search and Binary Search with additional enhancements for efficiency and performance.

##**Features**

1. Enhanced Linear Search

Works for both sorted and unsorted lists.

Finds all occurrences of a target element.

Uses parallel processing to improve performance on large datasets.

2. Enhanced Binary Search

Supports both iterative and recursive approaches.

Finds all occurrences of a target in a sorted list.

Uses Jump Search as a pre-check to eliminate unnecessary searches.

##**Technologies Used**

Python 3

Multiprocessing module (for parallel search in Linear Search)
